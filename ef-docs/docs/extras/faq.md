# Frequently Asked Questions

Some of the most asked questions on our Discord server.

---

### How do I play the game? 

If you're trying to figure out how to play, we've set up a [quick start guide](../intro.md) page that'll get you through the steps. We also have similar, shorter information via  Marla bot using `/manualsetup` and `/quickstart` on Discord.

---

### Why's my game laggy/choppy/unplayable?
It's likely you didn't install the Balance Patch. To install a patch, navigate to your game's root directory (where the .exe is located) and follow the path `g3/Content/Paks/`. Simply drag and drop the downloaded file into this folder.

You can find the download for the latest patch [here](https://cdn.elefrac.com/patch/latest.zip).

---

### How can I find games?

The Spellbreak Community Version didn't come with a functioning matchmaking system, which means that you will not be automatically connected with other players. To remedy this, you can monitor the game server's status and see who's online on Discord. Also there, and use the `@1v1`, `@Battle Royale`, and `@Arena/TDM` notification roles to find players.

### How come I don't see anything in Discord?

You probably need to verify. Make sure you use the Captcha bot on Discord or shoot us a message in the support channel.

### Why can't I connect to one of the servers?
If you're having trouble connecting, check out these suggestions:
- The server may be already in use. If a game is currently underway, and you attempt to connect, you will immediately be disconnected.
- Make sure you add the correct port `:7777` after the IP address, like this: `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:7777`. Other servers use different ports, so make sure you're using the right port for your game server. You can find all of this info in the [setup guide](../intro.md). 
- If you've already tried this, double-check that the server isn't already in use. The Pink Marla bot shows the players across each server.
- The server may be temporarily down.
- Though it's not explicitly mentioned, consider if your firewall is blocking the Spellbreak Community Version. This video on YouTube provides guidance on [configuring your firewall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNxHytT70AM).

### Help! I can't open the console!
If you're having trouble opening the console:
1. Make sure you're pressing the correct key, which is the tilde key (`~).
2. If you don't see the tilde key on your keyboard, your keyboard layout might not be in a generic English (EN) layout. You can use the Virtual Keyboard, available in Windows, with the EN layout. **You will need to make sure you change the layout BEFORE starting the game!**

### Can I use the server to play with my friends, or to play alone?

Certainly! You're welcome to use the server for 1v1 matches and Battle Royale, as long as you're not the only player in that game mode. Please be considerate of other players who may want to use the server. If the servers are occupied and you wish to play 1v1 or Battle Royale with one or two friends, consider [hosting your own server](https://github.com/ElementalFracture/Guides/wiki/How-to-Host-a-Server).

---

### How do I host my own server?
For instructions on hosting your own server, consult the guide on [how to host a server](../client-docs/host-a-server.md). It provides comprehensive details on the process.

---

### My friend can't connect to my hosted server. What could be the issue?
If your friend can't connect to your hosted server, consider these potential solutions:
1. Verify that you've correctly forwarded your port. While we can't offer direct support for this, consult your router's user manual or watch a YouTube tutorial. Confirm your port is open using a tool such as [canyouseeme.org](https://canyouseeme.org/) with your IP address and port `7777` while the server is running. A green checkmark indicates success.
2. Check your firewall settings.

---

### I don't like a particular ability. Can it be changed?
We're open to suggestions for changes. Feel free to join the active discussion on suggested changes in our Discord.

---

### Can I mod the game or make changes?
Absolutely! Elemental Fracture has already introduced balance patches, and you can learn how to install these patches in the [setup guide](../intro.md). Please note that if you have additional mods installed, you won't be able to play on Elemental Fracture as the conflict between our servers and your client would probably make for an unplayable experience.

---

### Is this game active?

Yes. Check our [Discord](https://dsc.gg/elefrac) to find some games!

---

### OMG!! Spellbreak is back?!?!11?!

Yes.

---

### Will this game ever come to the console/Steam/Playstation Store/Xbox Game Pass/Nintendo Switch Marketplace/Epic Games?

No. We would be breaking the law if we did, and we'd rather not get a lovely cease and decist letter for Copyright Infringement from Microsoft/Blizzard. Sorry.

--- 

### Can't you just buy the rights to the game?

Lol, no. I'm flattered you think I have the funds to do that, but no.
