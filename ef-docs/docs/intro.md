## Uninstall Previous Versions

If applicable, uninstall any versions of the original game (e.g., from Steam or Epic Games). You can do this by removing them from their respective clients or using "Add or Remove Programs" within Windows.

## A. Setting Up Using the Launcher (Highly recommended!)
<span style={{fontSize: '1.5em'}}>**!! We are aware of a major issue that is preventing the launcher from being used !!\**</span>

As of right now, the launcher setup is **unavailable** as we continue to work on releasing this fix. Please use the [Manual Setup guide](#b-manual-setup) in the meantime. Sorry about that!

## Connecting to Our Servers

Elemental Fracture hosts several dedicated servers for NA and EU, including Solos, Duos, Squads, and other game modes. To connect to a server:

1. On the main menu, replace the default server address (`127.0.0.1:7777`) with the IP address of the Elemental Fracture server you want to join followed by the port, separated by a **colon** (`:`).
2. You can find the latest server IPs in our [Discord](https://dsc.gg/elefrac).
3. If you prefer not to join the Discord, we've also added the game server ports you can connect to below:

**North America (NA): Beauharnois QC, Canada: 15.235.112.186**
- EF Solos: 7777
- EF Duos: 7778
- EF Squads: 7779
- EF Arenas/TDMs: 7780
- Chapter 3 Solos: 7781
- Chapter 3 Arenas/TDM: 7782

**Europe (EU) - Netherlands, Amsterdam: 45.142.233.218**
- EU Solos: 7777
- EU Arenas/TDMs: 7778

**Please note:** the EU servers are hosted by a member of the community and are not within Elemental Fracture's control, we will liaise with the owner in the event of issues.
