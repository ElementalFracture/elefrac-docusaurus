## General Changes

### UI / Effects
* Talent icons have been updated to reflect the talent categorization changes from the previous patch.
* Some duplicate Talent Icons now have their own unique visuals:
    * Intelligent
    * Scavenging
    * Focused Mana
* Fixed a missing visual effect when shooting lightning that was introduced in the last patch.

### General Gameplay
* Removed the ability to "double shot" with the Dodge mechanic.
* You are now able to carry multiple gauntlets and runes in your inventory without needing the Spellslinger talent.
* Fixed an issue that caused a game crash when Lightning and Wind interacted.

## Items

* Items have been rebalanced. Please see the provided spreadsheet for full details.
* Old items that did not grant Mana, Armour, or Speed on pickup now do.
* Items that had similar effects to others but were of a lower rarity have been vaulted for now.
* All remaining Equipment has been added into the Battle Royale loot pool.
    * **Known Bug**: The practice range will spawn random equipment of equal "rarity".
* With the above changes and rebalancing to Equipment, the previous house rule against "Double Dipping" is now gone. Theorycraft your builds!

## Runes
* **Shadowstep**: Invisibility duration increased by 0.25 seconds.
* **Blink**: Has been added to the Battle Royale loot pool.
* **Gateway**: Has been added to the Battle Royale loot pool.

## Class & Gauntlet Changes

* **New Level 1 Talent**: "Lightning Fast" has been added. It grants +5 run speed, but the effect breaks upon firing a spell or taking damage.
* **Lightning Gauntlet**: Max damage has been increased at higher rarities, and the damage fall-off range has been slightly increased for all rarities.
    * **Epic**: 8 (up from 7)
    * **Legendary**: 10 (up from 8)

    * Cost reduced to 2.
    * Target outline duration reduced from 3/5/7/10s to 1/3/5/8s.
* **Vigor**: Cost increased to 4.
* **Inspired**: Fixed an unintended cost decrease. The cost is now correctly set to 3.

## Skins
We have successfully implemented the ability to recolor skins (note: this does not add new skins). While these changes are client-side only, each of the Elefrac Staff & Modders have their own custom skins in the files for all to see.
* **Dauntless Defender**: Cap'n Happy
* **Duskglow**: Doobs
* **Inferno's Champion**: Thick Camille
* **Arcane Trickster**: Twdoor
